# :wave: Hi, I am Jose Luis Higuera Caraveo.

<img src='./images/presentation_image.png'/>

I am a **Data Scientist** passioned about maths. My aim is to be updated with the most innovating technologies that are changing the way the world is moving. I have been working on personal projects based on **Machine Learning** and **Deep Learning** techniques such as Regression models, Classification, Clustering, Dimensionality Reduction, Neural Networks and others.


I do not present myself as the most qualified candidate in technology and frameworks management, but yes, the one who loves to learn something new every day.

I worked on Hyundai Translead for 5 years as Product Engineer where I achieved to become a team leader. During my stay in the company, I developed soft skills such as:

- Teamwork
- Collaboration
- Communication
- Leadership
- Commitment
- Responsibility

# My Projects.

**Should we hire new staff?.**

Find out if, based on historical data, how the human resources department can predict which staff stays and which others leave the company.
- Techniques applied:
    - Logistic Regression.
    - Random Forest.
    - Logistic Neural Network.

**Which client looks like which client?.**

Notice how a bank can segment its customers based on their movement and thereby apply personalized advertising campaigns to each segment.
- Techniques applied:
    - K-Means.
    - Principal Components Analysis (PCA).
    - Autoencoders.

**Innovating the diagnosis of possible brain cancer.**

The early diagnosis of some diseases can translate into better treatments and therefore better results, helping to save human lives. Thanks to Deep Leaning we can achieve it.
- Techniques applied:
    - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).
    - ResNet.
    - ResU-Net.
